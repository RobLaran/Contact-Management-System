Third project for enhancing my back end skills.

The Contact Management System is a Java-based desktop application designed to manage personal information efficiently. 
This application allows users to add, delete, update, and view contact details such as names, phone numbers, emails, and addresses.
Users interact with the system through a simple GUI interface, enabling easy navigation and manipulation of contacts.

The application uses an ArrayList to store contacts in memory, with a database (MySQL). This makes it suitable for both temporary usage
during a session or for maintaining a longer-term contact database. Optional features include search, sort, and export functions to enhance usability.
This project offers practical experience with Java programming, object-oriented design, and basic CRUD operations.
